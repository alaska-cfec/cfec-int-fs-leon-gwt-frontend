There are other more periphial tables that are used in LEON as well, some are views for lookups. Here they are with brief functionality.

The RNW_* tables contain all records, not just those that participate in LEON.
RNW_ENTITY
This table is similar to the ARENEW_ENITTY table, but contains all records for current year for all permit holders or vessel owners. This is actually 
the master table that I use to query for changes in permit/vessel status. Don creates and upates this file twice a day, and rewrites it completely once 
a week. The fields are self identifying. When someone logs into Leon for the first time, this is where I can initially get their information and populate 
the screens. After a record is created, that data then gets recorded in the various ARENEW_* tables.

RNW_PMT
This table is similar to the ARENEW_PERMITS table, but contains all permit records. There are two fields in this file that I update. The renewal_status 
field is Available by default, I set it to Pending after a transaction occurs for the permit. When the processing is complete in licensing, Don will 
set this flag to Completed. I also add the confirmation_code to the record and Don maintains it throughout its existence.

RNW_VES
This table is similar to the ARENEW_VESSELS table, but contains all vessel records. Ther are two fields in this file that I update. The renewal_status 
field is Available by default, I set it to Pending after a transaction occurs for the vessel. WHen the processing is complete in licensing, Don will 
set this flag to Completed. I also add the confirmation_code to the record and Don maintains it throughout its existence.

RENEW_FISHERY
This is a view to the fishery table that I use when people want to purchase a new Permit. It contains the following fields:
FISHERY				-		Fishery Code
RESFEE				-		Resident Fee
NONRESFEE			-		Non Resident Fee
RESPOVERTYFEE		-		Resident Poverty Fee
NONRESPOVERTYFEE	-		Non Resident Poverty Fee
DESCRIPTION			-		Fishery Description
STATUS				-		Fishery availability (Y or N)
