Deployment.
All of the necessary libraries (exceptions later) are included in the application under the directory called libs. Simply include them in the
build path. The two exceptions that must come locally are your JDK and GWT libraries. Go to your buildpath and be sure to edit them to point
to your local versions. After the application has been successfully compiled, simply copy the contents of the war directory to a folder on
the j2ee application server within the deployment directory. That folder will become the name by which the app is served.

This project requires the installation of the Google Web Kit plugin for Eclipse. Simple instructions are readily available on there website.
Currently, we are using the 2.0.1 version, but anything in the 2.x should work.

These instuctions for deployment are based on the Tomcat j2ee container server, which uses a hot-deploy directory within it's root deployment directory. 
The simple creation of a folder, even with no content, will activate deployment of a project with the same name as
its folder. Within that folder is where you want to copy the contents of the compiled war directory. There are several automated methods for 
deployment, but at there base is the same simple concept. Another option would be to archive the entire project as a war file, then simply copy
that war file to the deployment directory and it will automatically explode are create all the necessary file structuers. While Tomcat is our
prefered j2ee server, the application should be compliant with most others.
