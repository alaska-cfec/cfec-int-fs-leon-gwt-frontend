Hey guys,

I wanted to send you some note on how to get eclipse with GWT plugin working with maven.   I try next to get this working in win7 64bit then its GXT, gilead and others!




 Today it's working in mint linux using eclipse 64bit Juno

Here is a page listing the special maven plug in eclipse needs:
http://pgt.de/2012/12/19/gpe-eclipse-and-maven-never-ending-story-done/

make sure you have:

What you need:

    m2e – maven integration for eclipse

    http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases
    m2e-wtp – maven Integration for WTP

    http://download.eclipse.org/m2e-wtp/releases/

I am using the latest stable releases from eclipse.org. Well, not always, I am going as stable as possible: the actual wtp integration is still in incubation… but works…

Talking numbers, this are the version numbers I used here:

    m2e – Maven Integration for Eclipse 1.2.0.20120903-1050
    m2e-wtp – Maven Integration for WTP (Incubation) 0.16.0.20120914-0945
    m2e connector for mavenarchiver pom properties 0.15.0.201207090125-signed-201209140800

I have installed a few m2e connectors I required for other non GWT projects, I think they are not


Run the mvn command that builds a GWT project:


http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/user-guide/archetype.html
They call this page a Maven GWT Plug in as far as I can tell the thing installs on the command line withwith:

 mvn archetype:generate \
   -DarchetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.mojo \
   -DarchetypeArtifactId=gwt-maven-plugin \
   -DarchetypeVersion=2.5.1




 
3.  Run gwt first on command line so project is compiled before you import into eclipse!  Took a while to figure this step out.

mvn gwt:run


4. import into file --> import --> maven ---> existing maven project

5. Project should import with one error:
Description    Resource    Path    Location    Type
Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.codehaus.mojo:gwt-maven-plugin:2.5.1:i18n (execution: default, phase: generate-sources)    pom.xml    /a1    line 69    Maven Project Build Lifecycle Mapping Problem

But will still run, right click project run as web application, proceeed with errors


6. fix above error with this xml added to your pom.xml beteen </plugins> and <build>

                </plugin>
            </plugins>

7. right click project ---> Maven --> update project

7.5  F5 or refresh project 


8. buy brant a beer for two days of figuring this out.
