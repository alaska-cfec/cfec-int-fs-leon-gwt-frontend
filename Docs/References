The frame of this project is based on the Google Web Kit and their particular methodology of Rich Application Web Development. Outside of
the occasional GWT method, the acutal GUI widgets come from a different source (more later). It is necessary to become familiar with
GWT construction, directory structure, handlers and most importantly their RPC method. (Remote Procedure Call). This allows an ajaxian type service call
from a client to a server with field level updates. All cient code, as well as server code, is written in Java. During compilation, optimized 
javascript is automatically generated within the war directory for client upload. No more coding in JavaScript.

Here is a link to the GWT site. http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/

I recommend going through their docs and tutorials.

The GWT library includes widgets for GUI construction, but it is certainly not their strength, they focus more on process then aesthetics.
Because of that, I am using a seperate library for GUI widgets called GXT. GXT is basically the ExtJS library converted to pure Java. 

Here is a link to their site. http://www.extjs.com/products/gxt/?ref=learnmorebluebutton

GXT is in itself a complete framework, not requiring GWT, but I prefer the GWT methodology of services and development, so I use GXT for its
widget library alone. Creating a new GWT project via the GWT toolkit requires some modification to incorporate the GXT library, which I will 
document later.

Other library requirements.
